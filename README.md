# StockHawk
Udacity Project Number Three

**Changes made to original project:**
* Checks put in place when trying to add new stocks, and warnings displayed, if stock already exists in database or cannot be found online
* Stocks changed to uppercase at time of entry to guard against duplicate entires (eg: one upper and one lower case)
* Clicking on a stock symbol opens a second screen which charts the stock price over time (user configurable via added settings menu) and calculates highest and lowest points
* RTL layout mirroring support
* All strings in stored in xml for easy language addition
* Homepage collection widget displaying the current stock database
* Content description added for main interface button
* Clear notification to user (and appropriate limiting of functionality) when device is offline
